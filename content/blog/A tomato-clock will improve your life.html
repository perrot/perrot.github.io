A tomato is a time block. It is 25 minutes. Every 25 minutes takes a break. Rest five minutes. If I finished 4 tomato clock, I will have a long break 25 minutes. I think that this is a good method to evalute how many tomatos you can create one day. 

A tomato-clock in the Chrome browser is good. I found one in GitHub site. It is [Tomato Clock](https://github.com/samueljun/tomato-clock). You can install it in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tomato-clock/enemipdanmallpjakiehedcgjmibjihj).
