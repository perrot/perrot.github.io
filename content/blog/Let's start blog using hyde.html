## Edit post
Go to the directory your_site\content\blog. All posts html will save here. If I want to write a new post, I copy a template.html to what_I_want_to_write.html. 

After I finished my what_I_want_to_write.html post, the important thing is I have to update some text in the index.html. Then I can see the recently post in my web browser just press F5 key. 

## Add images
* Go to the directory your_site\content\media\images. Save the image to here. Restart the hyde serve and refresh the web page.
* Or I rename the image file name. I have to restart hyde serve.
