## The benefit of exercise
* Increase your confidence - If I have a good body, I will feel good.
* Become more smart and productivity.
* Fear - Someday I will sick, I think that I have to do some exercise.

## Set a goal
* Focus only one goal and write it down - It is hard to achieve multi goals at the same time.
* Broken down into small tasks
* Setting the highest priority task is to exercise
* Evaluate your progress - Measuring body weight
