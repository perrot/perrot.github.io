When I start jekyll, jekyll shows this message **invalid byte sequence in UTF-8**. It means that I use Chinese file name. I replace Chinese file name with English file name. It fixed. If the message shows again, the meaning is the content of file contains Chinese characters. But I don't save it as UTF8 encoding. 

# Action

*. Replacing Chinese file name with English file name.
*. Save the file as UTF8 encoding.
